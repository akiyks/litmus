# Convert LISA litmus test to C-language version and verify that they
# produce the same results.  The C-language version is discarded.
#
# Usage: sh lisa2c-check.sh herd-args lisa.litmus
#
# Note that a C-language litmus test might not be semantically equivalent
# to its LISA-language counterpart.  For example, LISA and C have slightly
# different semantics for control dependencies.  The verification ignores
# such details.
